# Fix Summary: Module Import Error Resolution

## Problem
The error `Cannot find module '/var/task/server/db' imported from /var/task/server/routes/auth.js` occurred because:

1. The `api/test-register.js` file was trying to import TypeScript files (`.ts`) directly
2. In Vercel's serverless environment, TypeScript files need to be compiled to JavaScript
3. The import paths were incorrect for the deployment environment

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created JavaScript Module Versions
- **`server/db.js`** - JavaScript version of database connection
- **`server/routes/auth.js`** - JavaScript version of auth routes  
- **`server/index.js`** - JavaScript version of main server

### 2. Fixed Import Issues
- Updated `api/test-register.js` to use direct database connection
- Modified `api/index.mjs` to properly route test-register endpoint
- Updated `vercel.json` configuration for proper serverless function handling

### 3. Added Testing Tools
- **`test-db-connection.js`** - Local database connection test script
- **`deploy-fix.md`** - Deployment instructions and environment variables
- Added `test:db` npm script for easy testing

## Files Modified
1. `api/test-register.js` - Fixed imports and simplified database connection
2. `api/index.mjs` - Added proper routing for test-register endpoint
3. `vercel.json` - Updated configuration for serverless functions
4. `package.json` - Added test:db script

## Files Created
1. `server/db.js` - JavaScript database module
2. `server/routes/auth.js` - JavaScript auth routes
3. `server/index.js` - JavaScript server module
4. `test-db-connection.js` - Database connection test
5. `deploy-fix.md` - Deployment documentation
6. `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_PORT` 
- `DB_USER`
- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `DB_NAME`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

## Testing
1. Run locally: `npm run test:db`
2. Test endpoints after deployment:
   - `/api/test-register`
   - `/api/ping`
   - `/api/debug`

## Security Issues Found
The code review also identified several security issues that should be addressed:
- Hardcoded credentials (move to environment variables)
- Code injection vulnerabilities 
- Cross-site scripting issues
- Missing CSRF protection
- Improper certificate validation

These are documented in the Code Issues panel for further remediation.
